# React PokeDex App

This is a PokeDex web application created using React with Vite. The app uses the PokeAPI to display a list of Pokemon from every generation, as well as specific details for each individual Pokemon.

The application uses several external libraries, including:

- React Query
- Radix
- Axios
- React Router DOM
- Styled-components

The application is written in TypeScript, and it also uses Prettier and ESLint for code formatting and linting.
